# Machine Learning Projects
I am placing here a series of personal experiments I have conducted into machine learning, both in my spare time and during personal development time with THG Accelerator program.

As well as exploring the basics of a variety of interesting areas within the field to build my knowledge, I also consider the potential applications within e-commerce, including the creation of a product recommendation system which utilizes TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency) for MyProtein product descriptions, with successful results. 

As well as the successful experiments I include the less successful ones, for future reference and to build upon as I gain experience - e.g. the Trump speech generator using Keras. (A simpler markov model proven much faster and more effective!)
